# Check Yo' Self


### My Learning Goals:

In this project, the final project of Module 1 at Turing School of Software and Design, I hoped to:
1. Improve my ability to utilize and pass data back and forth between objects.
2. Properly utilize event delegation and event handlers.
3. Write clean DRY code. 
4. Get comfortable making user input data persists through browser refreshes and restarts.
5. Cap off a great module with a solid project and prove to myself that I can do this!


### My Experience:

Here are some of the many lessons I learned while working on Check Yo'self:
1. Even when you're working on a project by yourself, you're not in it alone. The stronger your community, and the more you rely on others and they rely on you, the stronger your code will be.
2. If you think you're a bit lost, you're probably 90% of the way there. Sometimes you just need a little push to get you through that last 10%.
3. It's amazing what a good walk and a mental break can do. 
4. Manipulating data on an object inside an array inside an object inside an array can get you a bit twisted up. Talking it out and diagramming it out helps keep it straight.
